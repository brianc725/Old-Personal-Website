# Personal Website

Website built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to show case my growing portfolio.

## Future Updates

As of August 2019, a new site is currently in development. This new site will feature a frontend in React
and a backend with Firebase. The backend will allow for dynamic loading of the website with routing from
React Router. Instead of having to update HTML each time there is an update, a new admin portal that I have
developed will allow for the creation, updating, and deletion of content on the site in an easy matter.
By having the backend, the update will be quickly reflected upon the next refresh or load of the site.
I am hoping to complete this within the month of September and officially replace this current site.
